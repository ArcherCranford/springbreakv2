# Project name:
Spring Break Trip

## Introduction:
This map represent a trip I will be taking for my senior year spring break. The map shows my starting location, Boone, NC, and my final destination, Rodanthe, NC. During the trip, I included three other points throught my trip. Two, Sheetz and Exxon, will be stopping points to fuel up. The 5th and last marker is considered my half way point, Raleigh, NC. This trip is only across North Carolina but will take around 6 and a half hours. 

## Functions:
Firstly, I used javascript to load in a leaflet map. With the leaflet map, I added a custom base map from https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/. Next, using a geojson file I made in geojson.io, I created the route in a linestring and markers as points. All together these functions created my map.
